# üì± Mobile Development Setup with Expo Go

##  Overview
Mobile development demands more computational power than web development due to device emulation and native builds.  
To simplify this, we‚Äôll use the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which lets you create, test, and run mobile apps seamlessly on physical devices ‚Äî no Android Studio or Xcode required.

This setup ensures a smooth, efficient, and cost-effective mobile development workflow.
